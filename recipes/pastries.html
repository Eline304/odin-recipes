<p> Puff pastries are the best late night snack or apetizer to share with your friends. They are golden and flaky on the outside and look  delicious with their cheese and spinach filling.</p>
<p>The best thing about puff pastries is that they are quick and easy to make. With this recipe you'll be baking a large batch so everyone can eat enough to satisfy their apetite.
 
 <h4>Ingredients</h4>
 
 <p><ul> <li>400g Spinach- You can use fresh or frozen spinach. </li>
  <li>200g Feta cheese- It's best to use a drier, crumbly type of feta. You can also use flavoured feta for a special taste. Flavours that feature chilli or garlic match great with the spinach.</li>
   <li>10 sheets of frozen puff pastry</li>
 </ul><p>
 
 <h4>Steps</h4>
 <p> <ol>
 <li>Preheat the oven on 200 degrees.</li>
 <li>Thaw the sheets of puff pastry until you are able to fold them, but not break them. Slice them down the centre vertically and horizontally to make 4 smaller squares.</li>
  <li>Prepare your spinach by blanching it in boiling water for 2 minutes. If frozen, thaw it. Squeeze out the excess water by wrapping it in a tea towel and wringing it out.</li>
   <li>Heat the spinach in a frying pan to cook off any extra water. Crumble feta over the spinach and stir it through until it's completely melted. <i>Note: Make sure to cook off as much moisture as possible. Otherwise your puff pastry won't stick together </i></li>
   <li>Divide the mixture over the 40 sheets of puff pastryM=</li>
   <li>Fold them in half diagonally so you make triangles.</li>
 <li>Bake them in the oven for 20 minutes until they are golden and flaky.</li>
