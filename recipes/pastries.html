<div class="steps">
 <h4>Ingredients</h4>
 <ul><li>400g Spinach- You can use fresh or frozen spinach. </li>
        <li>200g Feta cheese- It's best to use a drier, crumbly type of feta. You can also use flavoured feta for a special taste. Flavours that feature chilli or garlic match great with the spinach.</li>
        <li>10 sheets of frozen puff pastry</li>
 </ul><p> </div>
 
 <p></p>
 
 <div class="steps"><h4>Steps</h4>
 <ol><li>Preheat the oven on 200 degrees.</li>
     <li>Thaw the sheets of puff pastry until you are able to fold them, but not break them. Slice them down the centre vertically and horizontally to make 4 smaller squares.</li>
     <li>Prepare your spinach by blanching it in boiling water for 2 minutes. If frozen, thaw it. Squeeze out the excess water by wrapping it in a tea towel and wringing it out.</li>
     <li>Heat the spinach in a frying pan to cook off any extra water. Crumble feta over the spinach and stir it through until it's completely melted. <i>Note: Make sure to cook off as much moisture as possible. Otherwise your puff pastry won't stick together </i></li>
     <li>Dcivide the mixture over the 40 sheets of  puff pastryM=</li>
     <li>Fold them in half diagonally so you make triangles.</li>
     <li>Bake them in the oven for 20 minutes until they are golden and flaky.</li>
