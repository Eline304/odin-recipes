<p>Nachos have always made it a great late night snack; easy to make and everybody loves them (even the ones who claim not to be hungry). With three different types of toppings, these nachos look like a full dinner.</p>
<p>One of the best things about nachos is that they are flexible when it comes to ingredients so choose whatever amount you prefer. </p>
 
 <h4>Ingredients</h4>
 <ul><li>600 nachos- Choose a flavoured nachos like nacho cheese or chi limelli </li>
     <li>800g chopped tomatoes (canned)</li>
     <li>1 garlic</li>
     <li>1 lime</li>
     <li>3 avocados</li>
     <li>4 spring onions</li>
     <li>Soured cream</li>
     <li>250g grated cheddar cheese</li>
     <li></li></ul>
 <h4>Steps</h4>
 <ol><li>Preheat the oven.</li>
     <li>Cut the spring onions.</li>
     <li>Peel the avocados, remove the seed and chop in pieces.</li>
     <li>Press or cut 5 cloves of garlic.</li>
     <li>Spread the nachos across an oven dish. Divide the grated cheddar cheese over the nachos and place in the oven.</li>
     <li>Mix the chopped tomatoes with the chopped tomatoes, half of the garlic and half of the onions. Mix it and keep it apart in a dish. This is your salsa.</li>
     <li>Mix the avocadoes with the rest of the garlic and onion. Add the juice of the lime. <i>(Note: The lime juice will ensure your guacamole keeps it green color. Without it, it'll turn brown soon.), keep the guacamole in a different dish.</i></li>
     <li>Put the soured cream in a dish.</li>
     <li>Take the nachos out of the oven when the cheese is completely molten. Serve with the three dips and dig in!</li></ol>
